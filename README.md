- Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task. ✔
- Create at least one element using createElement. ✔
- Use appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM. ✔

### Description
- A fortune teller game inspired by the cootie catchers many of us used to play with as a kids. 
    - Enter your name, select a color and then choose a number to get your fortune or misfortune.

- What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
    - I could have built out a wireframe, I ended just relying on the picture of the idea in my head. Could help achieve my template much quicker and streamline the styling.

- Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
    - I think I need a better understanding of the DocumentFragment; I'm still a bit confused about its usage and implementation. It should get easier once I study it and try using it more.

- What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
    - I'd like to add some animations/transitions to it. Make it a little more fun to look at while playing the game.

- Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:
    - Continue improving on planning. Made some strides in that aspect in terms of formulating my plan with the code.
    - Dont forget about wireframes and putting my thoughts on paper to help clarify and keep consistency with my styling.
    - Read up on and practice DOM Templating(Document Fragments, HTML<template>, cloneNode) to help with execution.
